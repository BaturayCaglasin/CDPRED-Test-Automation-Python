Dear reader,

You are viewing the Python part of the project prepared for the position of CD Projekt Red - QA Engineer.The test automation project written in Java is written under the https://github.com/BaturayCaglasin/CDPRED-Test-Automation-Java repository.

In this project, **Python-Selenium-Behave-Gherkin-Allure Report** languages & frameworks were used.

In order to execute a test, on the terminal; "behave --tags=Test  /Users/baturaycaglasin/PycharmProjects/CDPRED-Test-Automation-Python/test/features/" should be type.

The report tool used is Allure Report; After the test runs are finished, the test run reports can be viewed after the command named "Allure Serve" written in the terminal.

I would like to point out that I admire CD Projekt Red! üòç Working with you is one of my greatest desires in my life. By connecting my passion for games since my childhood with my education and experiences; I would like to take part in projects together! ü•≥

* *I would like to point out that although my native language is Java Selenium BDD, I made this project to show you that I can adapt quickly. I spent 2 days in 3 days of assignments writing test cases in Java and developing the framework. In my last remaining day, by working Python; I tried to adapt my framework. By working hard, I can adapt to you quickly. By sharing my experience and knowledge with you; I can be super effective in the team.* 

Please send an e-mail to my baturaycaglasin01@gmail.com e-mail address if you have any questions about the project, codes etc.

Thank you! Best Regards,
