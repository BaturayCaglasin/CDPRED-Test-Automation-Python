Dear reader,

You are viewing the Python part of the project prepared for the position of CD Projekt Red - QA Engineer.The test automation project written in Java is written under the https://github.com/BaturayCaglasin/CDPRED-Test-Automation-Java repository.

In this project, **Python-Selenium-Behave-Gherkin-Allure Report** languages & frameworks were used.

In order to execute a test, on the terminal; "behave --tags=Test  /Users/baturaycaglasin/PycharmProjects/CDPRED-Test-Automation-Python/test/features/" should be type. (it was an example, the path should be on your file location.)

The report tool used is Allure Report; After the test runs are finished, the test run reports can be viewed after the command named "Allure Serve" written in the terminal.

Please send an e-mail to my baturaycaglasin01@gmail.com e-mail address if you have any questions about the project, codes etc.

Thank you! Best Regards,
